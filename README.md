Dialect Identification Using BERT
Description
This project focuses on identifying English dialects (Indian, American, and British English) using Natural Language Processing (NLP). By leveraging a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, the project captures linguistic nuances to classify text into the three dialects. This work demonstrates the potential of transfer learning for dialect classification, providing robust results with minimal preprocessing.


Features
Fine-tuned BERT model for dialect classification.
Multi-class classification of Indian, American, and British English dialects.
Contextual understanding of text for better accuracy.
Easy-to-run pipeline for training, evaluation, and prediction.
